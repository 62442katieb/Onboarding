# Onboarding
Resources and activities for new NBC lab members. Inspired by the [Whitaker lab's](https://github.com/WhitakerLab) great [Onboarding](https://github.com/WhitakerLab/Onboarding) repo.

## First steps
1. Sign up for a GitHub account (https://github.com/join?source=header-home).
    - We use GitHub to organize and share code related to our papers and ongoing projects.
    - You can sign up for a free account. By default, this does not come with private personal repositories, but you can either host private repositories under the NBCLab organization or [request an education discount](https://help.github.com/articles/applying-for-an-academic-research-discount/). They generally respond within a day or so.
2. Join the [NBC lab](https://neuroinformaticslab.slack.com) and [FIU neuroscience](https://fiuneuro.slack.com) Slack teams by asking [Taylor](mailto:tsalo006@fiu.edu) to send you an invite.
3. Send [Taylor](mailto:tsalo006@fiu.edu) a blurb, photo, and any relevant links for the [lab website](https://nbclab.github.io). You can see examples by navigating to lab members' personal pages from the [Team](https://nbclab.github.io/team/) page.
    - Ultimately, we would like you to contribute changes to the website (e.g., news or blog posts, updates to your profile) more directly, by forking the [lab website's GitHub repository](https://github.com/NBCLab/NBCLab.github.io), making changes to your fork, and opening pull requests back to the main repository. However, for new lab members, this is not necessary.
